<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This analysis leverages data from the National Transit Database (NTD) to provide insights into the financial and operational performance of various transit agencies in the United States for the year 2022. By focusing on key metrics such as farebox revenues, total unlinked passenger trips (UPT), vehicle miles traveled (VRM), and operational expenses, we aim to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of transit systems in serving their communities.</p>
<p>The analysis draws on three primary data sources: the 2022 Fare Revenue table, the latest Monthly Ridership tables, and the 2022 Operating Expenses reports. While the data may reflect some post-pandemic irregularities, the focus of this project is not on long-term forecasting but rather on a snapshot of transit performance during a pivotal year in the industry. Through this exploration, we will identify trends, highlight successful transit systems, and underscore areas where improvements may be needed.</p>

<p>This is useful, but not exactly what we want. Here, the UPT column refers to Unlinked Passenger Trips, which is a measure of rides (controlling for connections and transfers), and VRM refers to Vehicle Revenue Miles, roughly how far the transit provider travelled in total. Some of the other column names are less helpful, so let’s rename them using the rename function.</p>

<p>The Mode column is also helpful, but it uses a set of codes that aren’t interpretable. To make life easier for ourselves, let’s use a case_when statement to transform this into something we can make sense of.</p>

<p>On the NTD website we can find the interpretations of these codes: Alaska Railroad (AR) Cable Car (CC) Commuter Rail (CR) Heavy Rail (HR) Hybrid Rail (YR) Inclined Plane (IP) Light Rail (LR) Monorail/Automated Guideway (MG) Streetcar Rail (SR) Aerial Tramway (TR) Commuter Bus (CB) Bus (MB) Bus Rapid Transit (RB) Demand Response (DR) Ferryboat (FB) Jitney (JT) Público (PB) Trolleybus (TB) Vanpool (VP)</p>
<p>Now we can replace codes with corresponding interpretations in both tables USAGE and FINANCIALS:</p>

<h1>Table Summarization</h1>
<p>We are now ready to combine these usage statistics with the revenue and expenses data. Because our fare data is for 2022 total, we need to convert our usage table to 2022 summary info. We are creating a new table from USAGE that has annual total (sum) UPT and VRM for 2022. I am using the group_by, summarize, and filter functions, and the year function, to extract a year from the month column.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, this analysis of the 2022 transit data has shed light on the operational and financial dynamics of various transit systems across the United States. By examining farebox revenues, trip counts, vehicle miles, and expenses, we uncovered significant variations in performance among different agencies and modes of transport.</p>
<p>The findings reveal that certain transit systems excel in farebox recovery and passenger efficiency, while others may require strategic adjustments to enhance their financial sustainability and service effectiveness. Understanding these metrics is crucial for transit agencies as they navigate the post-pandemic landscape and strive to meet the evolving needs of their riders. Overall, this analysis provides a valuable foundation for future discussions on improving transit systems and optimizing resource allocation within the industry.</p>
